In building and maintaining APIs, using the correct HTTP status codes is crucial for effective communication between the client and the server. Here are some of the most commonly used HTTP status codes along with their meanings:

### 1xx: Informational
- **100 Continue**: The initial part of a request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server.

### 2xx: Success
- **200 OK**: The request has succeeded. The meaning of the success depends on the HTTP method used.
- **201 Created**: The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result.
- **202 Accepted**: The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is non-committal, meaning that there's no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of the request.
- **204 No Content**: There is no content to send for this request, but the headers may be useful.

### 3xx: Redirection
- **301 Moved Permanently**: This response code means that the URI of the requested resource has been changed permanently.
- **302 Found**: This response code means that the URI of the requested resource has been changed temporarily.
- **304 Not Modified**: Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the last request.

### 4xx: Client Error
- **400 Bad Request**: The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax).
- **401 Unauthorized**: Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorized", semantically this response means "unauthenticated". The client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.
- **403 Forbidden**: The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource.
- **404 Not Found**: The server cannot find the requested resource.
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: The request method is known by the server but has been disabled and cannot be used.
- **409 Conflict**: This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server.

### 5xx: Server Error
- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.
- **501 Not Implemented**: The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfill the request.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is not ready to handle the request.

These status codes help in making your API responses more informative and standardized, making it easier for the client to understand the response and act accordingly.
